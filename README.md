# Game of Life
Welcome to my Game of Life remake, powered by Java and Swing for CSE 563 at Arizona State University.

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains the following folders:

- src: This folder contains the source code of the application.
- lib: This folder contains any dependencies or libraries used in the application.
Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the bin folder by default.

## Getting Started
To get started with the application, please follow these steps:

- Clone the repository or download the files into a local directory.
- Run the App.java file within your Java environment.
- Click on squares in the application window to color or uncolor them as you wish.
- Once you have a pattern that you are satisfied with, click on the 'Start' button to begin generating generations.
- Note that due to constraints with Java Swing and Java, the application can only show up to 999 iterations per pattern, if needed.
- The algorithm will stop automatically once the board is filled with only unpopulated spaces.
- You can learn more about the rules of the game by clicking on the 'Explanation' button.
- The 'Clear' button clears the grid, and the 'Next' button iterates through the generations one by one.
